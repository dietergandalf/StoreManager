Now let me create a simplified DTO for the ProductStock with minimal product information to avoid circular references: 

Made changes.

Now let me create a summary of all the DTOs I've created: Perfect! I've successfully created comprehensive DTOs for your Store Manager application. Here's a summary of what I've created:

## Core Entity DTOs:
1. **AddressDto** - For address information
2. **PersonDto** - Base DTO for person entities (excludes password for security)
3. **CustomerDto** - Extends PersonDto with cart reference
4. **OwnerDto** - Extends PersonDto with stand information and business logic fields
5. **SellerDto** - Extends PersonDto with product stock and stand references
6. **ProductDto** - For product information
7. **ProductStockDto** - For product inventory with seller and product details
8. **ProductStockSummaryDto** - Simplified version to avoid circular references
9. **StandDto** - For stand information with owner and user details
10. **ShoppingCartDto** - For shopping cart with calculated totals
11. **CreditCardPaymentDto** - For credit card payment information
12. **PayPalPaymentDto** - For PayPal payment information

## Request DTOs:
1. **LoginRequestDto** - For user authentication
2. **RegisterRequestDto** - For user registration with user type
3. **UpdateProfileRequestDto** - For profile updates
4. **ChangePasswordRequestDto** - For password changes
5. **AddToCartRequestDto** - For adding items to cart
6. **CreateProductRequestDto** - For creating new products
7. **CreateStandRequestDto** - For creating new stands

## Utility DTOs:
1. **ApiResponseDto** - Generic response wrapper with success/error handling and static helper methods

## Key Features of the DTOs:

### Security Considerations:
- Password fields are excluded from DTOs to prevent accidental exposure
- Credit card numbers should be masked in real implementation
- Sensitive information is properly separated

### Performance Optimization:
- Foreign key relationships are represented as IDs with optional names
- Circular references are avoided
- Summary DTOs are provided for lightweight operations

### Flexibility:
- Builder pattern for easy object creation
- Calculated fields (like totalAmount, totalItems) for convenience
- Generic response wrapper for consistent API responses

### Best Practices:
- All DTOs use Lombok annotations for cleaner code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper inheritance hierarchy for Person-related DTOs
- Separation of concerns between request and response DTOs

These DTOs provide a clean layer between your REST APIs and your domain models, allowing you to:
- Control what data is exposed to clients
- Handle different representations of the same data
- Avoid circular references in JSON serialization
- Implement proper validation and transformation logic
- Maintain API stability while evolving your domain models

You can now use these DTOs in your controllers and services to create a robust and secure API layer for your Store Manager application.


To add CI/CD to your Store Manager project, you'll need to set up automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying your application. Let me first examine your current project structure to understand what's already in place. Based on your project structure, I can see you have a multi-service application with:
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Maven (Java 21)
- **Frontend**: React application 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose setup

Here's what you need to implement CI/CD:

## 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

I'll create a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow:

## Summary: What You Need to Do for CI/CD

Here's your complete CI/CD setup checklist:

### 1. **Repository Setup**
- [ ] Push your code to GitHub if not already done
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for `main` branch
- [ ] Create `develop` branch for staging

### 2. **Secrets Configuration**
Add these secrets in GitHub Settings > Secrets:
- [ ] `SONAR_TOKEN` (if using SonarCloud)
- [ ] `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` (if using Docker Hub)
- [ ] `DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD` (if using Docker Hub)

### 3. **Environment Files**
- [ ] Copy .env.example to .env for development
- [ ] Create `.env.prod` for production with real values
- [ ] Never commit .env files to git

### 4. **Maven Dependencies**
Add these to your pom.xml dependencies section:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 5. **Application Properties**
Add to `application.properties`:
```properties
# Actuator endpoints for monitoring
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics,prometheus
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
```

### 6. **Frontend Package.json**
Add these scripts to your package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint src/ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --fix"
  }
}
```

### 7. **Deployment Process**

**For Development:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**For Production:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Windows
scripts\deploy.bat
```

### 8. **Pipeline Features Included**

✅ **Automated Testing**
- Backend: Maven Surefire tests with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Jest/React Testing Library tests
- Test coverage reporting

✅ **Code Quality**
- Static analysis with SpotBugs
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Optional SonarCloud integration

✅ **Build & Deploy**
- Multi-stage Docker builds for production
- Container registry publishing (GitHub Packages)
- Environment-specific deployments

✅ **Monitoring**
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Application health checks

### 9. **Next Steps**

1. **Set up the repository** with the files I created
2. **Configure secrets** in GitHub
3. **Test the pipeline** by creating a pull request
4. **Set up monitoring** by accessing Grafana at `http://localhost:3001`
5. **Configure alerts** based on your needs

This CI/CD setup provides:
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and building on every commit
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging/production
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and secure deployment practices
- **Monitoring**: Complete observability stack
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality checks before deployment
